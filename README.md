## Stack Information

Next.js is a lightweight framework for static and serverâ€‘rendered applications.

#### Things to note using Next.js
1. All the pages of the application falls under /pages folder.
2. Next.js uses the App component to initialize pages. Thus adding context set up into [_app.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/#custom-<app>) ensures all pages have easy access to the main context of the application.
3. [_document.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/#custom-<document>) is used to set up the application's meta data.
